## Introduction

Heart disease is a major health issue worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project focuses on building a predictive model to classify the presence of heart disease based on several medical attributes. The goal is to help in early diagnosis and potentially save lives by enabling timely medical intervention.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease). It includes 303 instances with 14 attributes:

1. Age
2. Sex
3. Chest Pain Type (4 values)
4. Resting Blood Pressure
5. Serum Cholesterol in mg/dl
6. Fasting Blood Sugar > 120 mg/dl
7. Resting Electrocardiographic Results (values 0, 1, 2)
8. Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
9. Exercise Induced Angina
10. ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest
11. Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment
12. Number of Major Vessels (0-3) Colored by Flourosopy
13. Thal (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect)
14. Target (1 = presence of heart disease, 0 = absence)

## Model

The project uses several machine learning algorithms to find the best-performing model for heart disease classification. The main steps include:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** 
2. **Model Training:** 
3. **Evaluation:**
